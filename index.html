      <p>
        Hi, I'm Priya — born and raised in the vibrant city of Mumbai, India. My love for henna began at home, where I started applying henna on my mom’s hands. She adored it so much that no occasion felt complete without it. I was just 10 years old when I applied my very first design on her — and she loved it! Word quickly spread among family and friends, and soon I was everyone's go-to henna artist. My journey began right there. I even did my first bridal henna at just 14 for a close family friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though my style has evolved over the years, my connection to henna and its roots has remained strong and meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        After moving to the United States, I hadn’t planned on continuing my henna journey. But as fate would have it, in 2016, a friend’s daughter was getting married and had hired a professional henna artist. When their assistant couldn’t make it, I offered to help. What started as a spontaneous gesture turned into a turning point — everyone loved my designs and encouraged me to pursue it further. That moment reignited my passion, and I haven’t looked back since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I truly love what I do. There’s nothing more satisfying than seeing the joy and smiles on my clients’ faces after their henna session. Each design I create is done with love, patience, and care — using only homemade, all-natural henna cones that I personally prepare for a safe and beautiful experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking to add a touch of henna magic to your life, I’d love to be part of your journey. Contact me today to schedule your appointment — and let’s bring your henna dreams to life.
